# MatriCom Analyses

Here, we present two analyses using [MatriCom](https://github.com/Izzilab/MatriCom). The first analysis uses publicly available open-access datasets from a large panel of tissues and cell types, and the other is a case study identifying communication networks in the kidney matrisome performed by the Naba Lab (https://naba.lab.uic.edu/).
