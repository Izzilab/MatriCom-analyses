# MatriCom Analyses

Here, we present two types of example analyses involving [MatriCom](https://github.com/Izzilab/MatriCom). The first uses open-access data, publicly available online, from many tissues and cell types, and the other is a case study of kidney matrisome communications by the Naba Lab (https://naba.lab.uic.edu/).
